# zira-backend
This is the back-end section of the project in which is a large part of the logic of the project where we manage the routes for the API.
We use the Sequelize ORM to manage the query for the database that is built in the MySql language, the development of the logic is built with the NodeJS environment
## Developer mode
To create a database you have to install mysql and set the environment variables with mysql info in dev.sh file.
## Run
Run "dev.sh" file with command "source" ["source dev.sh"].


To use this you have to set the PORT in enviroment variables, if you don-t do this you will get a 502 error gateway.
